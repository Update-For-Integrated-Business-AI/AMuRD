## Abstract

> Key information extraction involves recognizing and extracting text from scanned receipts, 
enabling retrieval of essential content, and organizing it into structured documents. 
This paper presents a novel multilingual dataset for receipt extraction, addressing key challenges in information extraction and item classification. 
The dataset comprises $47,720$ samples, including annotations for item names, attributes like (price, brand, etc.), and classification into $44$ product categories. 
We introduce the InstructLLaMA approach, achieving an F1 score of $0.76$ and an accuracy of $0.68$ for key information extraction and item classification.
